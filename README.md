# Final Project- Selenium
### Description

Selenium is an open-source project that allows automated testing of web applications across various browsers and platforms. It provides a suite of tools for automating web browsers, including a browser automation framework, a WebDriver API, and a language-specific client library. With Selenium, developers and testers can write scripts to simulate user interactions with a website, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating through pages. Selenium supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and JavaScript, making it easy to integrate with existing testing frameworks. It is widely used in the industry for testing web applications, ensuring they work as expected across different browsers and operating systems. Additionally, Selenium is highly extensible, enabling developers to create custom plugins and integrations to extend its capabilities.

### Business Context

The Selenium Project is formed by a community of users and open source contributors who develop, use and promote the different Selenium projects (IDE, Grid, WebDriver) and other related things, with the end goal of benefiting the community as a whole. The Selenium Project wants as much as possible to operate using procedures that are fair, open, inviting, and ultimately good for the community. Selenium is primarily used for but not limited to automated testing of web applications. It helps developers and testers quickly identify and fix issues with applications, ensuring that they work as expected across different browsers (Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Chrome, etc)  and platforms.

### Key Quality Concerns
1. <b>Test Stability:</b> Selenium tests must be reliable and consistent, producing the same results each time they are run.
2. <b>Test Coverage:</b> Selenium tests should cover all essential features and functionalities of the application under test.
3. <b>Test Maintainability:</b> Selenium tests should be easy to maintain, update, and modify when the application changes.
4. <b>Test Performance:</b> Selenium tests must be efficient and not overly burden the system, as this can cause false test results.
5. <b>Test Scalability:</b> Selenium tests should be able to handle a large number of test cases and execute them quickly.
